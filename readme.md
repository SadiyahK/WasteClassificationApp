# Building and Running Python Model Training Code

The code to make, train and test the model is available in the python-model folder in the file named tf-classifier.py. 

1. To run the training, use a terminal to navigate from your home directory to the python-model folder. 
2. Then, type the name of the file, tf-classifier.py, this should run the code and train the model. 

Beware, running this code to train the model took me 6 hours.
